										<div class="col-12">
											<h4>Usability Aspect Reports</h4>
											<p>We tracked and analyzed critical usability issues observed during user testing. These findings helped us understand where users struggled and informed our recommendations for improvement. In total, we created 12 of these usability aspect reports. I have included a few of the most important critical isues below.</p>
											<!-- Issue #1 -->
											<div style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 1.5em; border-left: 4px solid #68d391; margin-bottom: 2em; border-radius: 6px;">
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Issue: Inconsistent “Passes & Fees” Section</h5>
												<p><strong>Observed During:</strong> Task 2</p>
												<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Some participants couldn't locate the "Passes & Fees" section on specific trails. There was also an issue of fee amounts not being displayed. These inconsistencies led to confusion and task failure.</p>
												<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Missing fee information could result in users being unprepared, leading to poor user trust or legal issues (e.g., tickets).</p>
												<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Always display the "Passes & Fees" section—even if no info is available—along with a note like "No fees required." Include the dollar amount of passes and fees to avoid unpreparedness.</p>
												<blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #555; border-left: 4px solid #ed8936; padding-left: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
													“Maybe it only shows it if the trail actually requires a pass, I can't find this section anywhere in the trail information”
												  </blockquote>
												  
											  </div>
											<!-- Issue #2 -->
											<div style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 1.5em; border-left: 4px solid #f6ad55; margin-bottom: 2em; border-radius: 6px;">
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Issue: Add-to-List Button Missing or Hidden</h5>
												<p><strong>Observed During:</strong> Task 4</p>
												<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Users had difficulty adding a trail to a list because the “add” or “save” button was either missing or not discoverable on the trail page.</p>
												<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Adding trails to lists is a core function of the app. If users can’t locate this button, it undermines the organizational features AllTrails promotes.</p>
												<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Ensure every trail page includes a clearly labeled and visible "Save to List" button near the top of the interface.</p>
												<blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #555; border-left: 4px solid #ed8936; padding-left: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">
												“The popular trails are added to the list, but I’m not sure how to add this one… I don’t know where the thingy is for this one.”
												</blockquote>
											</div>
											
											
											<!-- Issue #3 -->
											<div style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 1.5em; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed; margin-bottom: 2em; border-radius: 6px;">
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Issue: Trail Results Organization Confusing</h5>
												<p><strong>Observed During:</strong> Task 1</p>
												<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Participants were unsure whether trail results were ordered by distance, difficulty, or rating. This led to hesitation and second-guessing during the trail selection process.</p>
												<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> If users don’t understand how results are sorted, it adds cognitive load and can make the app feel unpredictable or disorganized.</p>
												<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Clarify how trail results are ordered—e.g., by default sort, distance, rating, or difficulty—using labels or tooltips above the result list.</p>
												<blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #555; border-left: 4px solid #ed8936; padding-left: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">
												“I got confused… is it based on how far away it is, or how long it is, or the star rating?”
												</blockquote>
											</div>
											
											<!-- Issue #4 -->
											<div style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 1.5em; border-left: 4px solid #fc8181; margin-bottom: 2em; border-radius: 6px;">
												<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Issue: Can't End a Custom Hike</h5>
												<p><strong>Observed During:</strong> Task 4 (accidental)</p>
												<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> One user accidentally started a custom hike while trying to add a trail to a list and then couldn’t figure out how to stop the hike once they left the “Navigate” screen.</p>
												<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Unintended activity tracking may result in inaccurate data, battery drain, or user frustration—especially if they don’t know the app is still running in the background.</p>
												<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Add a persistent mini-widget or indicator that allows users to pause/end a hike from any screen, or confirm start/stop more clearly within the Navigation UI.</p>
												<blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #555; border-left: 4px solid #ed8936; padding-left: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">
												“I’m stuck on the map. How do I get off the custom map now?”

										<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em;">
										Based on our usability study, we identified several actionable ways to improve consistency, feature accessibility, and user feedback within the AllTrails mobile app.
										</p>
									</div>
									</div>
								
									<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
										<h4>Usability Improvements</h4>
										<ul>
										<li><strong>Unify page structure:</strong> Ensure all trail pages display standard sections like “Passes and Fees,” even when data is unavailable. Use placeholder text (such as “No fees listed for this trail.”).</li>
										<li><strong>Clarify sorting of trail lists:</strong> Show users how results are organized (e.g., distance, popularity) to reduce confusion.</li>
										<li><strong>Rename “Saved” tab to “Lists”:</strong> Makes the feature’s purpose clearer and easier to locate.</li>
										<li><strong>Make the “Save to List” button consistent:</strong> Ensure users can add trails from any trail page, not just from popular listings.</li>
										<li><strong>Improve interface consistency:</strong> Parks and trails should share a consistent layout and button options.</li>
										<li><strong>Rename buttons for clarity:</strong> For example, label the download button as “Download Map” to avoid confusion with saving or bookmarking.</li>
										<li><strong>Add an “End Hike” button:</strong> Provide an easy way to stop a hike once started. Consider a floating widget with “pause/end” functionality.</li>
										<li><strong>Enhance feedback indicators:</strong> Lengthen the duration of review submission confirmation popups to reassure users their action was successful.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								
									<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
										<h4>Interface & Accessibility Enhancements</h4>
										<ul>
										<li><strong>Highlight sorting logic visually:</strong> Bold or label what each trail list is sorted by (e.g., “Sorted by distance”).</li>
										<li><strong>Improve visibility of key buttons:</strong> Relocate or emphasize hard-to-find actions like “mark as complete.”</li>
										<li><strong>Use industry standards:</strong> Apply clear navigation, back options, and icon labels to meet user expectations.</li>
										<li><strong>Label trail actions clearly:</strong> For instance, users should not be able to leave a review without also marking a trail complete.</li>
										<li><strong>Address premium feature confusion:</strong> Make it more obvious which features are paid vs. free, especially around downloads.</li>

											<div class="row">
												<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
													<h4>What Worked Well</h4>
													<ul>
														<li>We developed detailed user personas early, which helped us create realistic, relevant tasks.</li>
														<li>Running moderated sessions allowed us to observe subtle user frustrations in real-time.</li>
														<li>Working as a team of four allowed us to divide tasks efficiently: moderation, note-taking, and analysis.</li>
														<li>We gathered useful qualitative insights that led to actionable recommendations without needing to build a prototype.</li>
													  </ul>
												</div>
												<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
													<h4>What I'd Do Differently</h4>
													<ul>
														<li>Recruit more than 6 participants, which would allow for more insight into how effective the current app is.</li>
														<li>Recruit a more diverse range of participants to avoid over-relying on a college-student demographic.</li>
														<li>Visualize insights with mockups to support recommendations.</li>
														<li>Add more tasks for users to complete, as there were some parts of the app we did not gert to test.</li>
														<li>Record more than two critical incidents per participant.</li>

											<p>While this was completed for a class, if it were to be an actual commercial project these are some of the next steps I would take:</p>
											<ul style="margin-top: 1em;">
												<li><strong>Develop low-fidelity wireframes</strong> to explore solutions for the most critical usability issues, such as saving trails or organizing trail lists.</li>
												<li><strong>Conduct follow-up testing</strong> using updated tasks and proposed interface changes to validate whether the recommendations improve performance.</li>
												<li><strong>Expand participant demographics</strong> beyond college students to include parents, older adults, and casual outdoor users for broader insight.</li>
												<li><strong>Collaborate with designers</strong> to create polished UI mockups that address both visual clarity and accessibility best practices.</li>
												<li><strong>Present findings to stakeholders</strong> to make the case for design changes and begin the process of actually implementing the ideas within the app.</li>

												This evaluation focused on the usability, consistency, and learnability of the Signal Messenger app. Using a combination of <strong>heuristic evaluation</strong> and <strong>cognitive walkthroughs</strong>, our goal was to uncover usability issues that affect the onboarding experience, contact management, privacy controls, and core communication features such as messaging and calling.
											  </p>
											  <ul>
												<li>Evaluate how intuitive Signal’s interface is for first-time users during common tasks like adding contacts or verifying privacy settings</li>
												<li>Assess whether Signal's UI adheres to standard design heuristics</li>
												<li>Identify points of friction or confusion that could disrupt core user actions like calling, messaging, or editing settings</li>

										</div>
										<p>A cognitive walkthough is a usability evaluation method that assesses how easily a new user can complete can complete specific tasks within an interface. We used this method to identify points of confusion or friction in Signal's core workflows, focusing on whether first-time users could navigate features without prior knowledge or external help. This allowed us to evaluate the app’s learnability and surface-level intuitiveness, especially for functions related to adding new contacts.</p>
										<p><strong>Note:</strong> Successful steps will be green, and unsuccessful steps will be red.</p>

												<li><strong>1. Will the users try to achieve the right effect?</strong> Yes, by opening the app the user will be presented with the correct page.</li>
												<li><strong>2. Will the user notice that the correct action is available?</strong> Yes, the contact/messaging page shows users a list of people they’ve spoken with or called on the app.</li>
												<li><strong>3. Will the user associate the correct action with the effect they are trying to achieve?</strong> Yes, they will see a list of people they can find safety numbers for by navigating to this page.</li>
												<li><strong>4. If the correct action is performed, will the user see that progress is being made toward the goal of the task?</strong> Most likely, aside from having a separate “Contacts” page, the “Chats” page does a good job of showing users the individuals they can find safety numbers for.</li>

											<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;"><strong>Insight:</strong> While most of the task flow is intuitive to new users, we found there was an issue with tapping a contact’s name within a direct message to show contact information. While I think this may be intuitive to some users that more information can be found by clicking on the name, in the context of trying to verify a safety number it can be confusing. Improving the visibility of this feature, through an icon that shows up the first time opening a message for a new user or a more conventional menu would make this critical security feature more discoverable and easier to complete.</p>

											</ul>
											</div>
										
											<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;"><strong>Insight:</strong> While the task of adding a new contact through “New Messages” begins with a familiar and clearly labeled entry point, users encounter several usability issues as they progress. The pathway to add a contact is not intuitive, as users may not realize that clicking into the contact input field opens a new screen for contact management, due to a lack of visual cues or guidance. Additionally, the search functionality within that screen is unreliable, freezing during use and preventing users from locating contacts. Finally, after selecting a contact, the app offers no confirmation or feedback that the action was successful, leaving users unsure if the contact was added. These issues highlight gaps in discoverability, error prevention, and visibility of system status, which collectively hinder task completion and user confidence.</p>

										<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em;">
										Based on our cognitive walkthrough and heuristic evaluation of the Signal app, we identified a range of usability challenges related to feature discoverability, interface consistency, and system feedback. These issues impact task success, particularly when users attempt to add new contacts or receive calls. The following recommendations aim to improve task flow clarity, interface predictability, and user confidence in completing core actions within the app.
										</p>
									</div>
									</div>
								
									<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
										<h4>Usability Improvements</h4>
										<ul>
										<li><strong>Fix search bar freezing:</strong> Ensure the search bar in the “New Messages” screen functions properly to prevent task failure when searching for a contact.</li>
										<li><strong>Add feedback for contact addition:</strong> After clicking “Done,” provide a confirmation popup or visual indication that a contact was successfully added.</li>
										<li><strong>Introduce direct contact add option:</strong> Allow users to add new contacts from the app settings or a dedicated “Contacts” page without needing to initiate a message.</li>
										<li><strong>Clarify action pathways:</strong> Update the labeling and behavior of the “contacts” field in the “New Messages” screen to clearly indicate that it can be used to add new contacts.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								
									<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
										<h4>Interface & Accessibility Enhancements</h4>
										<ul>
										<li><strong>Improve system feedback:</strong> Provide clearer and more consistent visual feedback when user actions are completed (e.g., adding contacts, sending messages).</li>
										<li><strong>Standardize navigation:</strong> Unify the behavior of profile and navigation icons across all major app sections to avoid confusion and unexpected menu changes.</li>
										<li><strong>Enhance error prevention:</strong> Clarify which features require acceptance (e.g., message requests) and ensure that users in contact lists do not face unnecessary barriers to communication.</li>
										<li><strong>Add tutorial for new users:</strong> Incorporate a brief onboarding or guided tutorial to explain key features like adding contacts, starting calls, and navigating safety settings.</li>

										<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h4>What Worked Well</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>Using Nielsen’s heuristics gave us a structured and repeatable framework to evaluate usability issues.</li>
											<li>The cognitive walkthrough allowed us to view the app through the lens of a first-time user and uncover gaps in learnability.</li>
											<li>Breaking down tasks step-by-step made it easier to pinpoint where confusion or friction occurred in the user journey.</li>
											<li>Our recommendations directly tied to observed usability breakdowns, which helped us form clear, actionable suggestions.</li>
											<li>Each team member doing individual heuristic evaluations allowed for more discoveries and put emphasis on repeated violations.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h4>What I'd Do Differently</h4>
											<ul>
											<li>Include more user perspectives through usability testing to validate the issues found in heuristic and walkthrough evaluations.</li>
											<li>Explore visual design solutions such as wireframes to better communicate how recommended changes might appear in-app.</li>
											<li>Spend more time exploring accessibility elements like text labels, icon contrast, and voiceover compatibility.</li>
											<li>Conduct walkthroughs on both iOS and Android to compare consistency and user experience across platforms.</li>

										<h2>Woebot</h2>
										<h4>Strengths:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Simple interface makes navigation and understanding easy</li>
											<li>Chatbot integrates with the tools section to make tracking progress easy</li>
											<li>24/7 availability of mental health help, it doesn’t fully replace human interaction but
												can help whenever</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Limited personalization for users</li>
											<li>Responses from the bot can feel generic, there is not an option for human
												interaction</li>
											<li>Limited visual engagement, pretty much everything is text based with only a small
												amount of multimedia</li>

									<div class="row" style="margin-top: 2em;">
									<div class="col-12">
										<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
										<ul style="font-size: 1.1em;">
										<li>There is a strong user need for personalization, simplicity, and emotional support.</li>
										<li>Many top apps gate essential features behind a paywall, limiting accessibility.</li>
										<li>A calm and minimal interface is more effective for stressed or anxious users.</li>
										<li>Chatbot-based approaches (like Woebot) are fine for an always available solution, but there needs to also be some way to connect users to another human.</li>

										<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em;">
										Before moving into a wireframe, I began by sketching core screens to explore the layout and flow of the mental health app. These low-fidelity drawings helped shape the different pages of the app, such as a loading screen, chatbot, planner, home/welcome screen, and resources/lessons.
										</p>
										<h4>Key Features:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Home Page:</strong> Mood tracker, lesson plan, resources, and schedule all accessible.</li>
											<li><strong>Chatbot:</strong> Simple interface with "history" to view all chat history and "summary" that gives a quick overview of the current conversation to emphasize talking points and aid reflection.</li>
											<li><strong>Journal:</strong> Opens on a schedule that allows users to track each day and retroactively add journal entries. Once user clicks on a day, they can type in their thoughts. There is a sidebar menu that opens allowing for users to add items to their schedule as they are journaling.</li>
											<li><strong>Resources and Lessons:</strong> This page has resources for users to learn about mental health and helpful strategies (Lessons), get connected with local providers (Providers), track their mood and emotions (Mood Tracker), and connect with other people in the mental health community by asking questions or starting conversations (Forums).</li>

											<div class="row">
												<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
													<h4>What Worked Well</h4>
													<ul>
														<li>Reviewing multiple mental health apps gave valuable insight into what should be included in my own designs.</li>
											<li>Reviewing other apps also gave me ideas for how to improve upon what is already in the market.</li>
											<li>Sketching first helped clarify core features before investing time into digital wireframes.</li>
											<li>The Figma prototype allowed for quick visual iteration and to see if my sketched ideas translate into an aesthetically pleasing app.</li>
											<li>Breaking down competitor strengths and weaknesses sharpened the goals of my own concept.</li>
													  </ul>
												</div>
												<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
													<h4>What I'd Do Differently</h4>
													<ul>
														<li>Test early concepts with real users to validate whether features meet needs and make sense.</li>
											<li>Produce paper prototypes to discover design flaws before committing to digital mockups.</li>
											<li>Include expert feedback (e.g., therapists or mental health professionals) to flesh out ideas.</li>
											<li>Create a higher fidelity prototype with custom images and designs to help with user testing.</li>

											<h3 style="color: #333; border-bottom: 2px solid #38b2ac; padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Next Steps</h3>
											<p>While this was completed for a class, if it were to be an actual commercial project these are some of the next steps I would take:</p>
											<ul style="margin-top: 1em;">
												<li><strong>Conduct user interviews</strong> with individuals navigating stress or emotional challenges to validate key features and emotional tone.</li>
											<li><strong>Develop high-fidelity mockups</strong> that incorporate calming visual language, accessibility best practices, and consistent interaction design.</li>
											<li><strong>Expand the Figma prototype</strong> to include full user flows like onboarding, journaling, and chatbot conversations for usability testing.</li>
											<li><strong>Perform usability testing</strong> with a diverse group of users to identify interaction breakdowns and emotional engagement effectiveness.</li>
											<li><strong>Consult with mental health professionals</strong> to refine content tone and ensure ethical and supportive design choices.</li>
